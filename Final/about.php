    Bob's Lawn Care has been in business since 1990. Our company started with two brothers
    with a passion for landscaping. We first started cutting the lawn of 3 neighbors and 
    within a year we took on as many as 30 clients in Mercer County. Our motto is treat each
    lawn as your own, we believe our success comes from our dedication to making sure each
    lawn has been trimmed, cleaned, and taken care of as if it were our own home. We currently 
    have a team of 15 dedicated works and over 200 clients.
